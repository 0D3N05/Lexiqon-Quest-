ðŸŽ® Welcome to Lexiqon Quest!

This is my first-ever game, and also my first-ever project!

I built it during my second semester of Foundation in Information Technology.

Unfortunately, some files were lost because I forgot to save them, and it's been difficult to recover them.

As a result, the game might not work properly â€” but Iâ€™ll be working on it soon!

Please enjoy it, and feel free to change anything you like. That would be awesome!

ðŸ§© About the Game:

- Name: Lexiqon Quest

- Lore: None

Date Created: July 2024 (exact date unknown)

Have fun, and thanks for playing!
